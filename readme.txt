Summary------------------------------------------------------------------------:
For the purpose of this assignment, we created 2 different versions.

In folder PA1, you will find a functional implementation of the assignment.
We do not use any objects. pa1.py contains methods to sample the csv file
and test.py contains code that will run several tests on the data set that's
opened.
To run this version, go to the folder PA1 and type:
    python test

In folder PA1OOP, you will find an OOP implementation of the assignment.
We follow the format given by the professor's slides with an ExemplarProvider,
SampleWithoutReplacement, and TestHarness class. ExemplarProvider opens and
handles the file, SampleWithoutReplacement handles sampling of the data, and
TestHarness utilizes SampleWithoutReplacement to sample the data set.
To run this version, go to the folder PA1OOP and type:
    python TestHarness

Dependencies--------------------------------------------------------------------:
The following are required for the program to execute
- Python 3.5.1
- numPy
- matplotlib (pyplot)
